    <h2>
      History
    </h2>
    <p>
      Guiding Eyes is an internationally accredited, nonprofit guide dog school with a 50-plus year legacy of providing the blind and visually impaired with superior Guiding Eyes dogs, training, and lifetime support services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cornell Club for Guiding Eyes for the Blind was started in the Spring of 2011 by a handful of students deeply involved in the Finger lakes Region. Our mission is to raise awareness of guide dog puppy training on campus and to bridge the
      community with these puppy raisers and sitters.
