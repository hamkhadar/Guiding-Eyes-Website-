      <p> The best way to get involved is to come to our General Body Meetings, which are held four times a semester. Information about the date and location of these meetings are always sent to our email list and will be posted on our Facebook and
        Instagram a few days before each meeting.

        If you wish to be added to our mailing list to receive updates about meetings, events, and additional ways to get involved you can send an email to guidingeyes@cornell.edu requesting to be added.

        In order to be selected to become a puppy sitter, you need to be dedicated, come to meetings, events, puppy classes, and other opportunities that arise as the semester progresses. </p>

        <h3> There are three main ways for students to get involved with Guiding Eyes for the Blind at Cornell: </h3>

        <dl>
          <dt> 1. General Body Member: </dt>
          <dd> Students who may not have the time to dedicate to directly working with our dogs can be General Body Members. These members come to three out of the four general body meetings a semester.</dd>
          <dd>These meetings consist of going over important club related information, dog or training related activities, holiday parties, elections, guest speakers, or other worthwhile activities. General Body Members can also help volunteer at
            events and fundraisers to support the club.</dd>

          <dt> 2. Puppy Sitting: </dt>
          <dd> Guiding Eyes at Cornell typically has between 15-25 sitters every year, and they are responsible for the training and care of a variety of the dogs anywhere from two hours a week to having a dog overnight. </dd>
          <dd> Puppy sitting is a great way to be involved in the training for multiple of our dogs, and is a good alternative for those who do not have the time to raise a puppy.</dd>

          <dt> 3. Puppy Raising: </dt>
          <dd> Student have the ability to raise a puppy from when they are 8 weeks old until they are 16-18 months old.</dd>

          <dd>Puppy raisers are the primary individual responsible for the wellbeing and training of their puppy, but there is a network of support and sitters that help them along the way.</dd>

          <dd>Raisers can request sitters through the President of the club and can set up a weekly sitter schedule and/or additional sits as needed.</dd>

      <h2> DONATE </h2>
      <p> Guiding Eyes for the Blind is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) agency that depends on the support of individuals, corporations, foundations, and civic organizations such as Lions Clubs to fulfill its mission. We receive no government funding, and we
        provide our renowned Guiding Eyes dogs, plus training and lifetime support, to our blind and visually impaired students at no cost to them. It costs approximately $50,000 to prepare our students and dogs to become a Guiding Eyes team. Your
        donation, of any size, is important. You can make a contribution today.</p>

      <p> Please consider donate to Guiding Eyes for the Blind at Cornell. With your kind contribution, we will be able to continue to raise our lovely guiding eyes dogs on campus, and to award them with nice treats for helping their
        physically-challenged human friends. We will also be able to maintain the organization's presence at Cornell, and to share your kindness to our national organization, so that our doggy friends serving in other regions can feel your love as
        well.</p>

      <p>You may donate to us through cash, check, or venmo. Our venmo account is @guidingeyesatcornell. No matter how big or small or a donation, your kindness is always appreciated. We thank you on behalf of our loyal doggy friends! </p>
